In Cursor State, a Wii pointer tracks to the opponent at all times. The opponent can be placed in Cursor State by
landing %ref(wii aim,wii aim,s) or by using ???. This state lasts for a set amount of time or until Goopert is hit. All
items that perform attacks such as %ref(Funny Fork,Funny Fork,_), %ref(Blue Bird,Blue Bird,_), and
%ref(Fishing Rod,Fishing Rod,_) will home into the opponent's current position. Additionally, when drawing an item
with %ref(behold!,behold!,p), Goopert can influence the direction of the falling item using 6 or 4 to pull the item
forwards or backwards respectively.

[[Character.Items]]
Type="Summary"
Description="""
Goopert is able to summon a wide variety of items at any point. These items can be created using %ref(behold!,behold!,p),
???. The pool of items that can be summoned are in random order, but the next three will always be displayed on the HUD,
giving Goopert or the opponent a chance to strategize their next moves. Some items are activated immediately upon
drawing, some are activated once they land, and others require someone to pick them up before they can be used.
Items that are thrown on the ground stay there until they are used.
